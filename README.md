# Sprint-4-Project
# This project involves taking a dataset, performing basic analysis, creating visualizations of the dataset, and then uploading through render.
# For this project, I will be using a dataset that shows information about various cars listed for sale. 
# I will be using vscode, github, streamlit, and render for this project.
# The app will have a checkbox to choose which graph to view.
